# MTG-Card-Collection-Tool
Repository for my MTG Card Collection Tool project

A tool that takes input values based on a Magic: The Gathering card's characteristics, finds the USD market and buylist values of a card with those characteristics on TCGPlayer.com, and creates or updates a database entry for the card with the given values.
