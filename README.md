# MTG Card Collection Tool

Takes input on card characteristics
Scrapes TCGPlayer for the price data
Stores price data in a database

Development Roadmap:

Create basic framework
- take input
- scrape web
- make database entry

Iterate on each step
- More advanced input (GUI?, choose site?)
- Scrape multiple sites (Card Kingdom, CFB, SCG, etc)
- Allow for specific updates in database - add/remove by qty
- Report back certain values (qty on hand, value)
